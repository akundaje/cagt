histone_clustering
==================
This folder contains code for clustering histone data.
There are two interfaces for the code: histone_cluster and make_plots.
histone_cluster clusters the data and gives an interface for viewing the 
clustering.  make_plots clusters the data and generates a number of figures.
See the README files in each of these folders for instructions on running each.

Organization
============
The code is meant to be run using histone_cluster.py and make_plots.py
located in histone_cluster/ and make_plots/ respectively.  Most of the code 
is in the src/ directory.  Parameters for both programs are located in
the parameters.py file in this folder.
